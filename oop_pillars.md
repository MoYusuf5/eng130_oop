# Object Orientated Programming

### What is OOP?
- Is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviours into individual objects


### What Are The 4 Pillars?
- Encapsulation - restricts access to methods and variables
- Abstraction - process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user.
- Inheritance - inherit methods from another class 
- Polymorphism - use of common interface for multiple forms (data types)

### What Are The Benefits?
- Reuse of code - DRY (Inheritance)
- Effective problem solving 
- Troubleshooting is easier (Encapsulation)
- Productivity - many libraries available
